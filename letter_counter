# The department you work for undertook a project construction that makes word / text analysis. 
# You are asked to calculate the number of letters or any chars in the sentences entered under this project.
# Write a Python program that;
# takes a sentence from the user,
# counts the number of each letter/chars of the sentence,
# collects the letters/chars as a key and the counted numbers as a value in a dictionary.
